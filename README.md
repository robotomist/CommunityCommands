# CommunityCommands for V Rising

CommunityCommands is a server modification for V Rising that adds chat commands that are compatbible with [VampireCommandFramework](https://github.com/decaprime/VampireCommandFramework). This is a spirtual successor in the line of ChatCommands by Nopey and RPGMods by Kaltharos. This mod is not a direct fork from that line and will not contain the RPG functionalities. It's purpose is to provide a generic collection of commands for a variety of community server needs.

## Commands

- `.bloodpotion`
- `.buff`
- `.cd`
- `.give`
- `.kill`
- `.rename`
- `.search item`
- `.spawnnpc`
- `.customspawn`

## kits

To use kits place a kits.json at the root of your server next to the vrisingserver.exe
An example kits.json is available see [a relative link](kits.json) which has one kit to spawn 3 bone rings.

`.kit [kit name]`
